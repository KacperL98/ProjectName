### HelloðŸ‘‹

The First step was adding in package.js dependecies

   ```
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-native-community/masked-view": "^0.1.10",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^5.9.3",
    "@react-navigation/stack": "^5.14.3",
    "react": "16.13.1",
    "react-native": "0.63.4",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "^1.10.2",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^1.13.2",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^3.1.9",
    "react-native-screens": "^2.18.0"
  },
```

also you can use the site [ReactNavigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)

The Next Step I created two folders(FirstScreen, SecondScreen) with files(styles.js, index.js)

clicking on the button will take you to the second layout
